## What is Automata Theory?

- A branch of computer science that deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as **automata**.

## Turing Machine

- The most general and powerfull automata.

## Chomsky Hierarchy

- A system proposed to classify grammars according to their expressive power (how complex a structure they can describe)
- 4 main types of grammar: Type 0(powerful) - 3(simplest)
- Each level is a subset of the previous level: 3 < 2 < 1 < 0
