# The Elements of Computing System

## Chapter 3 - Sequential Logic

### What is a sequential logic
- A digital logic with memory elements â€” can store values
- Implementation involves:
    - synchronization
    - clocking
    - feedback loops
- implementation needs a clock signal (in synchronous design)

```
The act of remembering something is inherently time-dependent
```

### What is a clock?
- A device that generates oscillating signal(continuous alternating signal without need of inputs)
- Generate a fixed-length pulse at fixed intervals
- The elapsed time from high to low signal is a cycle.
- The alternating signal is represented by the computer as binary: 1 or 0
- The signal is simultaneously broadcast to every sequential chip
- measured by hz(hertz) e.g 2ghz => 2 billion pulse per second

### What is a flip-flop
- The most elementary sequential element
- It stores 1 bit of data
- Changes of value will only apply at the clock edge (rising  or falling, depends on the design), it will not change immediately
- The value it has will persist until ca new value os explicitly loaded on a clock edge

## Others 

### Two types of digital logic
- Combinational (input based, no memory)  
- Sequential (has memory) 

### How are negative numbers represented in binary? 
- One way is to define it by making the leading 0 into 1
```
0001 = 1
1001 = -1
```
