# Web Performance Notes - Sept. 28, 2025

## FPS meter in Chrome

- It shows how smoothly the web page is rendering
- Allows you to view FPS rate to help with performance analysis

```
Browsers aim to render at 60 FPS(on most displays). That means a new frame every ~16.67 ms. If FPS are below this number then animation and scrolling looks laggy.
```

- You just need to open the `Rendering` tool and check the `Frame Rendering Stats`
