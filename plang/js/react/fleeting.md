# React Notes - Sept. 13, 2025


## What is React
- An open-source javascript library for building UI
- Developed by facebook in 2013

## Core principle of React
- Building complex UIs by combining smaller, independent, and reusable components.

`Components, props, and states are the three key concepts in React`

## Components
- Building blocks of a react application
- Small, independent, and reusable
- Returns a react elements that will be displayed in the screen

## Props
- Attributes or data passed into a component
- Read-only data, cannot be modified by the child component.

## States
- Value persist throughtout the lifecycle of the component
- A variable that triggers a re-render when changed or updated.

## Rules of React
1. Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component, can't be called inside conditions, loops, or other nested function
