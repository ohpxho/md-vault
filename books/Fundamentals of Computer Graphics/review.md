# Computer Graphics Knowledge Test - Chapter 2: Miscellaneous Math

## Question 1: Sets and Mappings

If set A = {5, 10} and set B = {x, y, z}, how many ordered pairs would be in the Cartesian product A � B?

**Your Answer:**

```
6 pairs: {5x, 5y, 5z, 10x, 10y, 10z}
```

> ✓ **Correct!** You got the count right (6 pairs). Minor note: Cartesian products use ordered pair notation like (5,x) rather than {5x}, but you clearly understand the concept!

## Question 2: Inverse Functions

Why can't the function f(x) = x^2 (if or all real numbers) have an inverse function? What property is it missing?

**Your Answer:**

```
Because the function is not bijective since an output can map to two inputs
```

> ✓ **Correct!** Excellent understanding. You identified that f(x) = x² is not injective (not one-to-one) because multiple inputs map to the same output (e.g., both 2 and -2 give 4).

## Question 3: Logarithms

What is the value of log2 8? Explain your reasoning using the definition from your notes.

**Your Answer:**

```
The value is 3 since it will take 3 times for dive 8 by 2 to get 1. When 2^3 = 8
```

> ✓ **Correct!** The answer is 3. Your explanation "2³ = 8" is spot on! The first part about dividing is a bit unclear, but you nailed the core concept: the logarithm is the exponent (3) that 2 must be raised to in order to get 8.

## Question 4: Discriminant

For the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0, what is the discriminant value and what does it tell you about the solutions?

(Remember: discriminant = B^2 - 4AC)

**Your Answer:**

```
d = 4^2 - 4(2)(2)
d = 16 - 16
d = 0

Since the discriminant is 0, there is a single repeated real solution

```

> ✓ **Perfect!** Excellent work! You correctly calculated the discriminant as 0 and interpreted it correctly. When d = 0, the parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point (one repeated real solution).

## Question 5: Trigonometry

In a right triangle, if the hypotenuse is 10 units and the side opposite to angle is 6 units:

- What is sin(0)?
- What is the length of the adjacent side?

**Your Answer:**

```
sin = 6 / 10 = 0.4

```

> ⚠ **Partially correct.** You have the right formula (sin = opposite/hypotenuse = 6/10), but the calculation is wrong: 6/10 = **0.6**, not 0.4. Also, you didn't answer the second part: using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + 6² = 10²), the adjacent side = **8 units**.

## Question 6: Angle Conversion

Convert 90deg to radians. Show your work.

**Your Answer:**

```
π/2 radians
```

> ✓ **Correct!** π/2 radians is the right answer. Great job! The conversion formula is: radians = degrees × (π/180°), so 90° × (π/180°) = π/2.

## Question 7: Bijection

Explain the difference between injective and surjective functions. Give an example of a function that is bijective.

**Your Answer:**

```
Injective means that the an output is ONLY map to a single input. While surjective means that all outputs are map to an input. Both of this property if met, the function can be inverse
```

> ✓ **Mostly correct!** You understand the concepts well. Minor clarification: Injective means each output is mapped by **at most one** input (one-to-one), and surjective means **every** element in the range is mapped by at least one input (onto). You're right that a function with both properties is bijective and can have an inverse!

## Question 8: Trigonometric Ratios

Using SOH-CAH-TOA, if you know that cos(0) = 0.8 and the hypotenuse is 15, what is the length of the adjacent side?

**Your Answer:**

```
cos = adjacent / hypotenuse
0.8 = x / 15
x = 15 x 0.8
x = 12

The adjacent is equals to 12

```

> ✓ **Perfect!** Excellent work showing all your steps. You correctly applied the cosine ratio (CAH from SOH-CAH-TOA) and solved for the adjacent side. The answer of 12 units is absolutely correct!
