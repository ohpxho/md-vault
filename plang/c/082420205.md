## What is the size of this struct from a 64-bit computer?
```
struct x {
    int a;
    char b;
}
```
- The size is total of 8 bytes. why?
```
int = 4 bytes
char = 1 byte
padding = 3 bytes

|char|     |int|
----------------
```

## What is memory alignment in struct?
- Placement of data in the memory that can help CPU to access data efficiently
- The alignment process includes adding a padding in between data.
- The added padding is calculated based on the size of the largest alignment requirement, memory allocated should be multiple of that size
- Aligned automatically by the compiler but can be  ommited 

`A struct base address must be a multiple of its largest alignment requirement`


- Processor doesn't read 1 byte at a time from memory, it reads **1 word** at a time. e.g. 32bit processor => 4bytes at a time
