## Introduction to Algorithm Design - Chapter 1

`An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task`

- Before thinking of the solution or the algorithm, understand and carefully define **set of allowed input instances** and **the required properties of the algorithm's output**.

**2 traps when specifying the output requirements of a problem**

1. Asking an ill-defined question. The goal is too vague.
2. The goal is overly complicated because it mixes criteria

### Counterexamples

- Cases or conditions that prove that the algorithm is incorrect.

**Properties:**

1. Verifiability - expectation and reality mismatch
2. Simplicity - Simplifying the example down to its essence (why the algorithm fails)
