# Inside The Machine

## Basic Computing Concepts - Chapter 1

`In a nutshell, a computer is a device that reads, modifies, and writes sequences of numbers. These three function-read, modify, and write- are the three most fundamental function that a computer performs, and all of the machines components are designed to aid in carrying them out.`

### 3 key components of a computer
- **Storage** (a location where cpu can read and write data)
- **ALU** (performs arithmetic and logic operations)
- **Bus** (carries the data to components)
