## Chapter 2 - Miscellaneous Math

### Sets and Mappings 
- Mappings are also called `functions`
- `∈` = is a member
- **Cartesian Product**
    - Denoted as `A X B`
    - All possible ordered pairs from A and B. 
    ```
    A = {1,2}
    B = {3,4}
    A X B = [{1,2}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}]
    ```
    - It is not only limited to two sets, can be extended to 3...n
- Notation for mapping:

```
f : R  → Z,
“There is a function called f that takes a real number as input and maps it to an integer.”
```
- input: domain; output: range

### Inverse Mapping
- Working backwards, fron output to input
- A function has an inverse function only if its bijective

### What is a Bijection?
- Bijection is surjective and injective
- `Injective`
    - One to one
    - One output is asigned only to one input.
- `Surjective`
    - All output are assigned to an input, no left unused

### Logarithms
- useful in problems that includes equation with enponential terms


```
log<sub>a</sub> x
a = base 
```

- defined as `the exponent to which a must be raised to get x`
- logarithm is inverse of exponentiation

### What is natural logarithm?
```
ln x ≡ log<sub>e</sub> x
```
- logarithm with base `e`, which is equals 2.718...

### Quadratic Equation
- This equation has the form:
```
Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0,

x = unknown
A, B, C = constants
```
- Graphing it give a parabola (a U-shape)
- The solution or roots for this equation are points that touches the x-axis where y = 0
- Methods for solving:
    - Factoring 
    - Completing the square
    - Quadratic Formula
- `Discriminant` tells us about nature of solutions 
    - > 0: 2 disticnt real solutions
    - = 0: one repeated real solution
    - < 0 Two complex roots

### Trigonometry
- The math of triangles 
- How angles and lengths relate
```
       |\
       | \
   a   |  \  c   (hypotenuse)
       |   \
       |____\
         b

    c = hypotenuse (the longest side)
    a = side opposite
    b = side adjacent, next to the angle
```
- Trigonometric ratios (most common):
    - Sine
    - Cosine
    - Tangent
```
SOH-CAH-TOA
Sine = opposite / hypotenuse
Cosine = adjacent / hypotenuse
Tangent = opposite / adjacent
```
- The two rays that have the same starting points are called the `side of the angle`

### Angles 
- Formed when two lines or rays meet at a vertex(points where lines meet each other)
- They could be positive or negative in nature
- counter-clockwise: positive; clockwise: negative
- Unit of measurement:
    - Degrees
    ```
    A full circle = 360°
    A right angle = 90°
    A straight line = 180°
    ```
    - Radians(rad)
    ```
    A full circle = 2π radians
    A right angle = π/2 radians
    A straight line = π radians
    ```
