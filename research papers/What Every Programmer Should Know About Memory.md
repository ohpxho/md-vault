# What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory

- `Commodity hardware` - mass produced, inexpensive, standardized
- Mass storage and memory subsystems fell behind(slow improvement) in terms of performance as the other components improved - making it a bottleneck in performance
- Removing the main memory as a bottleneck pose a lot challenges and requires to change to hardware:
  - RAM (speed and parallelism)
  - Memory controller design
  - CPU caches
  - Direct Memory Access(DMA) for devices
