## Implementing renew feature

- I will reuse the dialog form for adding a new document
- Some inputs will be disabled:
  - name
  - category (it doesn't make sense if this is changeable, if it's the same document type, it's on the same category - A license could not become a subcription or service all of a sudden)
-
