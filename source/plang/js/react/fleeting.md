## Core principle of React

- Building complex UIs by combining smaller, independent, and reusable components.

`Components, props, and states are the three key concepts in React`

## Components

- Building blocks of a react application
- Small, independent, and reusable
- Returns a react elements that will be displayed in the screen

## Props

- Attributes or data passed into a component
- Read-only data, cannot be modified by the child component.

## States

- Value persist throughtout the lifecycle of the component
- A variable that triggers a re-render when changed or updated.

## Rules of React

1. Hooks can only be called at the top level of the component, can't be called inside conditions, loops, or other nested function
