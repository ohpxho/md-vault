### Sets and Mappings 
- Mappings are also called `functions`
- `∈` = is a member
- **Cartesian Product**
    - Denoted as `A X B`
    - All possible ordered pairs from A and B. 
    ```
    A = {1,2}
    B = {3,4}
    A X B = [{1,2}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}]
    ```
    - It is not only limited to two sets, can be extended to 3...n
- Notation for mapping:

```
f : R  → Z,
“There is a function called f that takes a real number as input and maps it to an integer.”
```
- input: domain; output: range
