## Implementing substring function in C
> There are no existing implementation of substring like in java in C :(, so I gonna need to implement it on my own (I ask some help to chat-gpt for this hehe) 
> It took me a while to finish this since I am still confuse with pointers, eventually I was able to grasp the concept. And, it's not that hard.
