## Enums
- user-defined data type
- a way to assign or label integer contants
- **LIMITED TO INTEGERS ONLY**
```
enum day {
    SUNDAY,    // 0
    MONDAY,    // 1
    TUESDAY,   // 2
    WEDNESDAY, // 3
    THURSDAY,  // 4
    FRIDAY,    // 5
    SATURDAY   // 6
};
```
- by default, the first enumerator has value of 0, then will be incremented by 1, and will be assigned to the next enumerator
- values can be assigned manually
- using <mark>typedef enum</mark> is cleaner
```
typedef enum {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
} Color;

// Now you can use Color instead of enum color
Color favorite = RED;
```

## Malloc
- in standard library functio <stdlib.h>
- allows you to allocate a block of memory in the heap
- always remember to free the memory allocated (it will persist unless explicitly freed) as it can lead to <span style="color: red">memory leak</span>.
