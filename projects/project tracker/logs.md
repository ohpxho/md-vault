## Kanban implementation for task monitoring
> Each data provided should have specific column id. If you don't have one, you need to do some mapping

> The column id can be string, not only numbers. 

> Ids are on type string

## Should I continue with problem and notes feature?
> They could be helpful for reviewing blockers and corrective actions done.

> Is this really needed? I have these md notes to log problems I encountered. I can just create another app that helps with reviewing these notes.

> I can keep the notes for additional info, then remove the problems

> Hmmm. Now that I think about it, including problem/bug notes could help me with analytics. But, in what way? 

> I will continue with it! I thought that it could help me track backlogs

## TODO
## onClick in the kanban card is not triggering
> Tried adding onClick prop in the KanbanCard implementation, but this doesn't work either.
