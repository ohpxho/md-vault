# Maintainability

```
It is well known that the majority of the cost of software is not in its initial develop‐
ment, but in its ongoing maintenance—fixing bugs, keeping its systems operational,
investigating failures, adapting it to new platforms, modifying it for new use cases,
repaying technical debt, and adding new features.
```

- Writing readable code for ease of understanding of other enginners.
- Designing a software that will minimizes the pain during maintenance

1. `Operability`
   - A set of task done routinely to keep the system in check and run propoerly.
2. `Simplicity`
   - `A software project mired in complexity is a big ball of mud`
   - `When complexity makes maintenance hard, budgets and schedules are often overrun`
   - Good abstraction can help reduce complexity
3. `Evolvability`
   - The agility of the software - Easy to change adn adapt to new requirements
