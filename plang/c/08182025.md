## strncpy 
- part of standard library <stdlib.h>
- copies specified number of string s from one string to another
- definition:

```
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
```
- if n >= size of dest, it will not add a NULL terminator automatically, which will lead to buffer overrun
- in case that there are extra spaces in the dest after copy, all extra spaces will be filled with null bytes '\0'
